In this directory, we present the Joern outputs for 66 StackOverflow code snippets from Section III.

The directory structure is as follows:

``/snippets`` : Contains sub-directories ``snippet-x``, each containing the files ``code.txt``, ``dependencies.json``, and ``joern.out``. In cases where Joern generated an error for the code snippet, we attach the ``error.txt`` file.

``Joern-Output-Analysis.xlsx`` - Spreadsheet containing detailed analysis for all 66 code snippets.
